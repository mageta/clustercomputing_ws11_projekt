Cluster-Computing-Projekt ws11

Description of the Task can be found in 'docs/projektaufgabe.pdf'.
The documentation (main algorithm ideas, run-time-analysis and remarks) can be
found in 'docs/doku.pdf' (written in german).

To build the project just issue 'make' in the main directory. This should build
everything you need. The 'Makefile' (and 'helper/Makefile') expects a
mpi-compiler located in /usr/local/bin ('/usr/local/bin/mpicc'). If your
mpi-compiler is located somewjere else, pleas change the 'CC'-variable at the
top of the two makefiles, or create a smybolic link
(e.g. ln -s /usr/bin/mpicc /usr/local/bin/mpicc).

If you want to debug the programm, please change the Makefiles and comment out
the second 'CCFLAGS'-line plus uncomment the first one. This will issue the
compiler to not optimize the code, not to omit fram pointers and not to destroy
debugging-symbols. And do a >make clean< before rebuilding it with >make<.

executables:

./find_components <file>
	- main programm, should be run with mpi_run
	- expects a file as argument
		- the file should contain the matrix to be analysed; format:
			i/j . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . n (j in n)
			. a11, a12, . . . . . . . . . . a1n .
			. a21                           .   .
			. .                             .   .
			. .                             .   .
			. .                             .   .
			. .                             .   .
			. .                             .   .
			. .                             .   .
			. am1, am2, . . . . . . . . . . amn .
			m . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . m/n
			(i in m)

./pixelpattern <m> <n>
	- matrix-generator (no mpi)
	- can be used to generate input for ./find_components
	- to do so, issue it as follows:
		./pixelpattern 20 20 2>pat.txt

		-> pat.txt will contain the matrix
